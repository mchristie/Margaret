# Margaret

Margaret is a free-to-use service that aims to help the hard of hearing join in conversations.

Each person can join on their own device and transcribe their speech as they talk. These messages appear in near real-time on all devices.

This helps allow for naturally flowing conversations, including with people who aren't able to hear.
